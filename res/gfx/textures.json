// All texture files must be power of 2 in size.
// This file holds the real dimensions of textures.
// It is read by GraphicManager when the client is run, and the relative size of the texture is then
// passed to the fragment shaders to ensure that the proper portion of the texture is used.
// It is only necessary to specify size of texture which are not actually powers-of-2 textures.
// GraphicManager will assume textures not in this file are full-size.
